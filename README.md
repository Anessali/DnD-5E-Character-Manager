# DnD-5E-Character-Manager
This application is as much a character sheet as it is a database manager. The goal is to build an application that will allow its user to easily add and remove anything they need to build a character, from races with attributes and traits to an individual inventory for each character. 

Most of the information is being stored in a local database unique to each user. I may or may not store some information in xml files.

Currently in an early alpha stage, because aside from dice rolling the program isn't functional.

## Planned features

### Main
- [ ] Character Generation

- [ ] Database can store races, subraces, and classes
