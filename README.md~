# DnD-5E-Character-Manager
An application that will generate character sheets and display them. The goal is to build an application that will allow users to easily add and remove anything they need to build a character, from races with attributes and traits to an individual inventory for each character. 

Most of the information is being stored in a local database unique to each user. I may or may not store some information in xml files.

Currently in an early alpha stage.
